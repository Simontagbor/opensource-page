Today the Open Neural Network eXchange (ONNX) is joining the LF AI Foundation, an umbrella foundation of the Linux Foundation supporting open source innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

ONNX was co-founded by Microsoft in 2017 to make it easier to create and deploy machine learning applications. In the past few years, the machine learning landscape has evolved at a rapid pace, resulting in increased fragmentation across frameworks, tools, and hardware. ONNX accelerates machine learning innovation by reducing the friction caused by this fragmentation, thus speeding up the process of taking models from research to production.
