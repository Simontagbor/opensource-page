Yesterday, Helm became a graduated project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), joining a select group of projects that the CNCF recognizes for achieving majority adoption by the cloud-native community.

I want to extend congratulations and thanks both to the creators of Helm, as well as to the broader Helm community that has supported, extended, and enabled Helm to reach this significant milestone. The wider Kubernetes community is better for the foresight of Helmâ€™s creators and the persistence of the community. Thank you!
