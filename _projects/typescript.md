description: TypeScript is an open-source and cross-platform language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types and type-checking. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, and allow TypeScript to validate your code before it runs. Those types are also leveraged by TypeScript's editor engine to power things like code completion, go-to-definition, and quick info tooltips for both TypeScript and JavaScript users alike.
