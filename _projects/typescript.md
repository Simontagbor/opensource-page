description: TypeScript is an open-source and cross-platform language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types and type-checking. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, and allow TypeScript to validate your code before it runs. These types are also leveraged to power first-class editing experiences for TypeScript and JavaScript users alike, and for better documentation.
