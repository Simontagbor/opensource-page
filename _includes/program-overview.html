                      Trust is key to open source. Developers should be able to trust users to 
                      respect their licensing choices. And when you receive software, you should 
                      be able to trust that the open source licenses were followed.
                  </p>
                  <p>The <a href="https://www.openchainproject.org/" target="_new">OpenChain Project</a> 
                      plays an important role in building trust by setting standards that define how to operate a 
                      high-quality open source compliance program. It means that when you receive open source from a 
                      company that follows the OpenChain standard, you can be assured that the code went through a rigorous 
                      license compliance process. You can trust it.
