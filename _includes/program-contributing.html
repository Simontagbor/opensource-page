        <p><em>This is a summary of how we approach contributing to open source at Microsoft.</em></p>
        <p>
            We encourage our employees to contribute to open source communities. Contributing
            improvements to projects we use enhances the value everyone derives from the project
            and can drive a project forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft's contribution policy varies depending on the size and purpose of contribution.

                <b>Small changes:</b> 
                If your contribution meets the "small contribution exception" (like a bug fix), just 
                create a fork, make the fix, and submit a pull request. If making the pull 
                request on GitHub, you can create the fork in your personal GitHub account, rather 
                than an official Microsoft organization account.

                While the small contribution policy outlines all the specifics, we've made it easy
                to contribute to a number of great projects: small contributions can be made if there is
                no Contributor License Agreement (CLA), or, there is a list of specific CLAs that can
                be signed, such as those for the Apache Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, Linux Foundation,
                Google open source projects, the .NET Foundation, Python Software Foundation, the
                Unicode Consortium, and others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Larger changes:</b>
                If the contribution is larger, your contribution should be reviewed and approved. There
                is a contribution request form that will kick of a business and legal review process, 
                how to scope the request, and reviewing the contributor guide and any CLAs for the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Meet Community On Its Own Terms:</b>
                Note that different open source communities take contributions in different ways. 
                Before firing off a pull request, investigate how best to engage the community you 
                will be contributing back to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fork Nicely:</b> Always try to contribute to a community instead of hard 
                forking. Review internal guidelines and training before forking into a Microsoft org.
